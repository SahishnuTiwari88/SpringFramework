multipart resolver = sometimes client/user send pdf,photo,auto,video file using form, these are multi part data(multiple type data)
which can be handle/resolve by multipart resolver at server side.
for that purpose we have to add configuration of multipart resolver in our config.xml(or in java config file) by declaring bean

we will use common multipart resolver as it is implementation of multipart resolver
